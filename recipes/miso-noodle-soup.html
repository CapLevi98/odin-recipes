    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Our version of miso noodle soup in a jar was inspired by recipes on TikTok for miso soup in a jar. Try this heat-and-eat recipe for a warming main to 
        prep and tote all season long. Use jars labeled “microwave-safe” (check the bottoms) and never microwave the lids.

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
    </p> -->

    <ol>
        <li>Cut tofu into 1/2-inch planks. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Cook tofu, turning halfway through, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Cut tofu into cubes.</li>
        <li>Stir together green onions, miso paste, garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl. 
            Divide evenly among 3 microwave-safe pint-size canning jars with lids.</li>
        <li>Layer evenly with rice vermicelli noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Chill, covered, up to 5 days. 
            To serve, see “Heat and Eat”. Garnish with sliced green onions.</li>
    </ol>
